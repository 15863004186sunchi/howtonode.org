to [Node.js Knockout](http://nodeknockout.com/) on how to
use [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). This post was recorded
by [node-inspector](http://github.com/dannycoates/node-inspector) author
and [Node.js Knockout judge](http://nodeknockout.com/judging#danny_coates) Danny Coates.

## Transcription

It would be super cool if someone forked howtonode and sent me a pull request with a transcription of the video.  Then I could put it here.
