randomekek: hi is this personal chat?
[11:46pm] creationix: yep, what's up
[11:46pm] randomekek: im from yesterday
[11:46pm] randomekek: and i read your articles
[11:46pm] randomekek: it was informative, i wrote a thing similar to your parallel
[11:46pm] randomekek: instead you pass it promises
[11:47pm] randomekek: and you call start()
[11:47pm] randomekek: and it will return a promise when all promises have finished
[11:47pm] randomekek: useful for my code  thanks
[11:47pm] randomekek: im mainly saying here because the diqus thing is down
[11:48pm] creationix: disqus is down?
[11:48pm] creationix: I know it ate several of the original comments, but I thought it working for new ones
[11:48pm] randomekek: for me it says temp maintenance
[11:48pm] randomekek: i tried enabling js and cookies
[11:48pm] randomekek: some later time it gave me a 503
[11:48pm] creationix: I'm starting to think it's time to write a comment system in node
[11:49pm] creationix: I guess you get what you pay for
[11:49pm] randomekek: lol
[11:49pm] randomekek: they are having scaling pains
[11:49pm] creationix: true, but my support ticket to un-eat the missing comments has been in limbo for almost a week
[11:50pm] randomekek: haha i guess its time to node it out
[11:50pm] creationix: it looks like node is going to stick with promises for some things and regular callbacks for others
[11:51pm] randomekek: im confused about the inconsistency, although when u use a promise, yo lose the stack info for debugging
[11:51pm] creationix: I'm working on part three of the control flow series right now
[11:51pm] randomekek: but it probably clears the stack memory which is good
[11:51pm] creationix: exceptions and stack are tricky in async javascript, I should mention that in  my article
[11:52pm] randomekek: btw, im almost done writing a noob db (200 lines of js took me forever to write), now im debugging
[11:54pm] randomekek: and the worst thing about javascript you must mention, is that you need "var self = this", if you plan to do inner functions and object oriented stuff
[11:55pm] creationix: yeah, I take that for granted forgetting it kills newcomers
[11:57pm] creationix: maybe I'll have a short article about "this" "call" and "apply"
[11:57pm] creationix: understanding those goes a long way to mastering functions in JS
[12:00am] randomekek: this is critical, call and apply are somewhat useful sometimes. scoping and object patterns (you've got that)
[12:01am] randomekek: yoru Object.spawn is similar to the process.mixin right?
[12:02am] creationix: not really, it uses a process.mixin type pattern in it
[12:03am] creationix: I think the original Object.create came from this http://javascript.crockford.com/prototypal.html
[12:04am] creationix: look at the bottom
[12:04am] randomekek: oh i got leechblocked ... it's night already
[12:04am] randomekek: i'll bookmark it
[12:05am] creationix: cool, get some sleep, I should probably use leechblock sometime
[12:05am] randomekek: haha put one on 1am to 6am, and no editing when it's blocking
[12:05am] randomekek: it ruins ur life
[12:05am] randomekek: oh good night... no internet no fun
